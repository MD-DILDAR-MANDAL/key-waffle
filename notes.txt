**Step 1:
Decide on the criteria that make a password strong. This may include minimum and maximum length, the use of uppercase and lowercase letters, inclusion of numbers and special characters, and avoidance of common words or patterns.

**Step 2: Write a Function to Check Password Strength**
Create a Python function that takes a password as input and checks whether it meets the specified criteria. You can use regular expressions to check for patterns in the password.

**Step 3: Implement Password Complexity Rules**
Implement rules for different levels of complexity (weak, medium, strong) based on the password's adherence to your defined criteria.

**Step 4: Use Regular Expressions**
Use regular expressions to ensure that passwords contain the required characters and follow specific patterns. For example, you can use `re.search` to check for the presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

**Step 5: Provide Feedback**
If a password is weak, provide feedback on why it's weak and suggest improvements. For example, if it's too short, suggest a longer one. If it lacks special characters, recommend adding some.

**Step 6: User-Friendly Interface**
Create a simple user interface for users to input passwords and receive feedback on the strength of their passwords. You can use the `input` function to get user input.

**Step 7: Testing**
Test your password strength checker with a variety of passwords to ensure it accurately assesses strength according to your defined criteria.

**Step 8: Security Considerations**
Ensure that the password checking process itself is secure. Do not expose or store passwords insecurely during the strength-checking process.

**Step 9: Documentation**
Provide clear documentation on how to use your password strength checker, including any dependencies or configurations required.

**Step 10: Further Enhancements (Optional)**
Consider additional features such as integrating your password strength checker into other tools, maintaining a list of common passwords to check against, or implementing account lockout policies.
